This is not a complete function manual.  For all functions
please look in ../bitchx-docs/6_Functions/



Function: $left()
Usage:    $left(number text)

Example:  $left(5 the quick brown frog) returns "the q"

Function: $getkey()
Usage:    $getkey(channel)
Returns:  the channel key if there is one.
Example:  $getkey(#BitchX) should return nothing ;)

Function: $right()

Notes:     the first character is numbered zero.

Function: $rand()
Usage:    $rand(max)
Returns:  A random number from zero to max-1.
Example:  $rand(10) might return any number from 0 to 9.

Function: $srand()
Usage:    $srand(seed)

Side effect: seeds the random number generater.
Notes:     the argument is ignored.

Function: $time()
Usage:    $time()
Returns:  The number of seconds that has elapsed since Jan 1, 1970, GMT.
Example:  $time() returned something around 802835348 at the time I wrote
          this comment.

Function: $stime()
Usage:    $stime(time)
Returns:  The human-readable form of the date based on the <time> argument.
Example:  $stime(1000) returns what time it was 1000 seconds from the epoch.
Notes:    $stime() is really useful when you give it the argument $time(),
          ala $stime($time()) is the human readable form for now.

Function: $tdiff()
Usage:    $tdiff(seconds)
Returns:  The time that has elapsed represented in days/hours/minutes/seconds
          corresponding to the number of seconds passed as the argument.

Function: $index()
Usage:    $index(characters text)
Returns:  The number of leading characters in <text> that do not occur
          anywhere in the <characters> argument.

Function: $rindex()
Usage:    $rindex(characters text)
Returns:  The number of leading characters in <text> that occur before the
          *last* occurance of any of the characters in the <characters>
          argument.
Example:  $rindex(f three fine frogs) returns 12 (the 'f' in 'frogs')
          $rindex(frg three fine frogs) returns 15 (the 'g' in 'frogs')

Function: $match()
Usage:    $match(pattern list of words)
Returns:  if no words in the list match the pattern, it returns 0.
          Otherwise, it returns the number of the word that most
          exactly matches the pattern (first word is numbered one)
Example:  $match(f*bar foofum barfoo foobar) returns 3
          $match(g*ant foofum barfoo foobar) returns 0
Notes:    it is possible to embed spaces inside of a word or pattern simply
          by including the entire word or pattern in quotation marks. (")

Function: $rmatch()
Usage:    $rmatch(word list of patterns)
Returns:  if no pattern in the list matches the word, it returns 0.
          Otherwise, it returns the number of the pattern that most
          exactly matches the word (first word is numbered one)
Example:  $rmatch(foobar f*bar foo*ar g*ant) returns 2
          $rmatch(booya f*bar foo*ar g*ant) returns 0
Notes:    It is possible to embed spaces into a word or pattern simply by
          including the entire word or pattern within quotation marks (")

Function: $userhost()
Usage:    $userhost()
Returns:  the userhost (if any) of the most previously recieved message.
Notes:    $userhost() changes with every single line that appears on your
          screen, so if you want to save it, you will need to assign it to
          a variable.

Function: $strip()
Usage:    $strip(characters text)
Returns:  <text> with all instances of any characters in the <characters>
          argument removed.
Example:  $strip(f free fine frogs) returns "ree ine rogs"
Notes:    it can be difficult (actually, not possible) to remove spaces from
          a string using this function.  To remove spaces, simply use this:
             $tr(/ //$text)
          Actually, i recommend not using $strip() at all and just using
             $tr(/characters//$text)
          (but then again, im biased. >;-)

Function: $encode()
Usage:    $encode(text)
Returns:  a string, uniquely identified with <text> such that the string
          can be used as a variable name.
Example:  $encode(fe fi fo fum) returns "GGGFCAGGGJCAGGGPCAGGHFGN"
Notes:    $encode($decode(text)) returns text (most of the time)
          $decode($encode(text)) also returns text.

Function: $decode()
Usage:    $decode(text)
Returns:  If <text> was generated with $encode(), it returns the string
          you originally encoded.  If it wasnt, you will probably get
          nothing useful in particular.
Example:  $decode(GGGFCAGGGJCAGGGPCAGGHFGN) returns "fe fi fo fum"
Notes:    $encode($decode(text)) returns "text"
          $decode($encode(text)) returns "text" too.
          Yes.  $decode(plain-text) does compress the data by a factor of 2.
          But it ignores non-ascii text, so use this as compression at your
          own risk and peril.

Function: $ischannel()
Usage:    $ischannel(text)
Returns:  If <text> could be a valid channel name, 1 is returned.
          If <text> is an illegal channel name, 0 is returned.
Example:  $ischannel(i_am_not_on_this_channel) returns 0
          $ischannel(#i_am_not_on_this_channel) returns 1
Notes:    Contrary to popular belief, this function does NOT determine
          whether a given channel name is in use!

Function: $ischanop()
Usage:    $ischanop(nick channel)
Returns:  1 if <nick> is a channel operator on <channel>
          0 if <nick> is not a channel operator on <channel>
                  * O R *
          if you are not on <channel>
Notes:    Contrary to popular belief, this function can only tell you
          who the channel operators are for channels you are already on!
Boo Hiss: This should be $ischanop(channel nick <nick...nick>)
          and return a list (1 1 ... 0), which would allow us to
          call is_chanop() without ripping off the nick, and allow
          us to abstract is_chanop() to take a list. oh well...
          Too late to change it now. :/

Function: $word()
Usage:    $word(number text)
Returns:  the <number>th word in <text>.  The first word is numbered zero.

Function: $sar()
Usage:    $sar([g][r]/<search>/<replace>/<text>)
Technical:
          This function searches for the given search string in the given
          text, and replaces if with the replacement text, if a match is
          found.  The field delimiter may be any character; the first
          character found that is not a 'g' or 'r' is used.
Practical:
          This is the general purpose search-and-replace function.  It allows
          you to look for any arbitrary text substring in any text string, and
          replace it with another arbitrary substring.  Any of the strings may
          consist of variables to expand at runtime.
Options:
          g    replace all matches, not just the first
          r    assume text is a variable name; assign return value to variable
Examples:
          @ foo = [foobarblah]
          $sar(/oo/ee/booyamon)              returns "beeyamon"
          $sar(/oo/ee/foofoo)                returns "feefoo"
          $sar(g/oo/ee/foofoo)               returns "feefee"
          $sar(r/oo/ee/foo)                  returns and sets $foo to
                                             "feebarblah"

Function: $push()
Usage:    $push(var word1 word2 ... wordN)
Returns:  The value of $var with the given words appended to it (the var

Example:  $center(30 BitchX) returns "            BitchX"

Function: $split()
Usage:    $split(splitstring stringtosplit)
Returns:  a list composed of "stringtosplit" split using "splitstring"

          name. The "rval" is used only if the verb is "set", and is any
          sequence of octets.

          * The "GET" verb allows you to retrieve the value of an alias or
          assign named by "lval".
          * The "SET" verb allows you to set the value of an alias or assign
          named by "lval" to "rval".
          * The "MATCH" verb allows you to retrive the list of all same-level
          variable names that begin with "lval" (ie, command completion).
          Wildcards are not allowed, but the simple use of a single asterisk
          is allowed to match all assigns or aliases.
Example:  $aliasctl(alias get join) returns current value of alias "join"
          $aliasctl(alias set join //channel) sets an alias called "join"
          $aliasctl(assign match foo) returns all vars starting with "foo"
