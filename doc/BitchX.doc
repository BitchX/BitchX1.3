		Welcome to the documentation for BitchX for 
 		Windows 95/98/2000/NT/UNIX/OS/2/MacOS

BitchX is written and supported by me Colten Edwards (aka panasync@efnet).
BitchX represents a quite alot of my free time in the last 4 years.
I only hope that you enjoy using the client. It was written because of the
lack of what I considered a nice client under unix. Nice meaning a client
that included source and had features that were typically scripted adding to
the memory usage and cpu usage of the defacto client of the time ircii-2.8.
I had looked at epic 3, but considered it flawed at the time I looked at it.
After muddling around the ircii-2.8 source for several months I was able to
come up with something that added a few new features and thus BitchX was
born. At first BitchX was passed from person to person on irc as source
until finally a distribution bot was created to help. The very first
versions of BitchX I consider to be more than a little lame at this time but
that was then and this is now. The current versions of BitchX will compile
on more and more platforms, running for long periods of time. Something
unheard of with ircii-2.8. BitchX is epic compatible, meaning that scripts
written for epic will generally run without any modifications to the script
at all. BitchX has alot more "features" than epic itself making it a
hybrid. At one point in time source from pluto's version of comstud's
version of ircII was used in BitchX, but that is no longer the case..

BitchX includes alot of useful commands and functions for both the user and
the scripter. Internally the nick, flood and friends lists are held in 
hashed lists to make accessing them very quick compared to typical linked 
lists used in ircII. Some of this code has been contributed by Sheik of 
Ctoolz fame and some has been cooperated on with this same author. The 
internal xdcc/cdcc (cdcc meaning written in c as opposed to script) lists 
are extremely functional and modifiable by the scripter. The first version 
of cdcc was written by me and then replaced with cdcc written by Ananda. I
doubt he'd recognize the code that he contributed to BitchX. Everything is
configurable on the display using /fset and /wset commands. fset was
unwittingly contributed by hellshock (aka kraig) after he renamed my source
and coded /fset along with some other war "features" (cavlink). This was
known as hADES for which no source was released. I liked the idea so I coded
my own which functioned like his. Surprisingly enough he liked my code so
much more than his that he used it in his own client after which the source
was released. 

I'd like to take a quick opportunity to thank all those that have made
BitchX so much a success. It actually surpassed any of my own expectations
which were just to create a better ircII. Enjoy the client, and remember one
thing when you visit #bitchx on efnet, we are all volunteers. So answering
your questions may either be not possible or we've answered our daily 
quota (tired). It's not that we are not interested.

[Win95 notes]
Many people over the past year have tried to port BitchX to a Win95/NT
environment, but nobody has ever been successful to my knowledge. Success
depended on a working select() and alarm() function from the underlying c
libraries, and until CYGNUS released their beta 18 unix emulation library,
this port was not feasible without rewriting large portions of the code.
More information about CYGNUS can be found at www.cygnus.com, as well you
can download their emulation libraries and tools at the same place. YES you
too can port your favorite unix programs. One other block that I found
when starting this port was that there term handling wasn't quite upto
handling a screen intensive program like BitchX. Compiling ncurses or
termcap was a possibility but the underlying term handling still couldn't do
everything that was required of it. So I looked at the linux console driver
and used it as an example of how to emulate the features we need in order
to use a program like BitchX. Newer versions of the CYGWIN.DLL are available
from http://www.lexa.ru/sos

[General BitchX notes]
BitchX the client.

Starting BitchX is as simple as typing BitchX at a command prompt or
clicking on a icon. BUT there are some options which I'll list below.

Usage: BitchX [switches] [nickname] [server list]
	[nickname] can be at most 9 chars unless you have the source
	[server list] whitespace separated list of servers irc.vol.com:6666
	[switches] can be one or more of the following.
	-c <channel> 	Join channel on startup.
	-b		load bx-rc or irc-rc after connecting to a server.
	-p <port>	use <port> as the default port for the server
	-d		use BX in dumb mode
	-q		does not load irc-rc or bx-rc
	-r <file>	loads <file> as a list of servers
	-a		adds default servers and command line servers
	-v		show BitchX's version
	-l <file>
	-L <file>	Load <file> in place of bx-rc and irc-rc files.
			-L expands environment variables placed in it.
note. there are other switches that are os-type specific. ie -H under unix
for virtual hostname support. As well there might be other 

[Windows]
As well we have a few environment variables that should be setup so that
things will run smooth. (Remember this is a unix client port). One
thing that really helps this client is the existance of what's called a
$HOME directory. This is where the special character ~ (tilde) points to
in a unix enviroment. All the following need tobe set in either
autoexec.bat or the WinNT registry. Remember that changes to the
autoexec.bat file do not take effect until either you run the autoexec.bat
file or reboot the system. ~/bx-rc is the default startup file for the
client itself (where ~ means the HOME directory)


[Unix]
All the following can be or will be set in your environment already.
Depending on what type of shell you use for your account, will determine 
how these variables are set and what files you'll need to edit in order to
set them. For bash(gnu) the command is export whereas tcsh uses setenv. Also
filenames will range from .login to .cshrc or .bashrc or .bash_login. A
little detective work will be necessary (hint: ls -a) in order to figure
this out. As well the changes won't take effect until you re-login to the
account. ~/.bitchxrc or ~/.ircrc are the files that are loaded by the client
when we start. 
ex. 
bash:
	export IRCNICK=
	export IRCSERVER=
window/dos:
	set IRCNICK=
	set IRCSERVER=
	set HOME=

PLEASE be aware that anything that is channel dependant placed in the
startup files will NOT take effect. This is because we preload these files
as well as any scripts before we connect to a server and join any channels.


HOME		Sets the default directory where files are loaded and stored
		ex.  set HOME=/edwards

IRCNICK		Sets the default nickname to use

USER
IRCUSER		Sets the default "username" to use. "Unknown" is set if not
		found. THIS ONLY WORKS UNDER NON-UNIX OS'S.

IRCHOST
IRC_HOST	Sets the virtual host name to use. Don't worry about this
		one unless you need it.
IRCNAME		Sets the "name". when doing a /whois nick it is displayed
		next to the nick. also known as the realname.

IRCSERVER	Sets the default server to use

IRCPORT		Sets the default port to use. Usually 6667 or 6666

IRCPATH		Sets the path from which files are /load'd ie scripts.
		ex.  ".:~/irc" sets current directory and $HOME/irc as the
		directories to use when loading files.

IRCUMODE	Sets the default usermode

IRCRC		Sets the filename to use in place of irc-rc

IRCLIB		Sets the BitchX library path. (Used for some small example
		scripts).

IRC_SERVERS_FILE Sets the name of the irc-servers file that is loaded first
		before any other	

IRCFINGER	Sets your ctcp finger information. 

[Windows notes]
Unfortunately all the paths below can not be used like a DOS pathname yet.
So we need to fudge a few things. An example dos path is c:\winnt\system32
which would translate into a CYGNUS path of //c/winnt/system32. If all you
are going to use is c: drive then /winnt/system32 is fine.

irc-rc
bx-rc		This is used to load a default script when starting the
		client. This file is in the $HOME directory.

bx-conf		This directory is created in the $HOME directory
		the first time the client is run. The BitchX.hlp, BitchX.qt
		BitchX.qk files should be placed here. As well certain files
		are created by the client - BitchX.awy (your away msg log),
		BitchX.sav (/saveall creates this file) which contains
		your settings which are reloaded when you restart the client.
		It also contains your userlist, shitlist, auto-join list,
		bot-list, lame nick list etc.


irc-serv	List of servers which are loaded by the client. File is in
		the $HOME directory and has one server per line.

[Windows]
Currently a identd server will be required to use the client on most efnet
servers. I will look at the possibility of adding a small identd server to
the client internally. Of course if your root running some unix variant,
then many differant options exist for a identd server. Pick one and install
it. Personally I like cidentd which is available from sunsite.unc.edu.
Although cidentd is known to have several buffer overrun problems, these are
relatively easy to fix. (replacing strcpy()'s with strncpy()'s). There is
apparently a exploit floating around for this as well...


Most of the BitchX scripts will currently run with this windows client. 
Your only problem will be to get someone to actually give you a non-tar'd 
non gzip'd version. At some point I will make it so that you can just
download a package of all the scripts in one zip file. Currently the 
following popular scripts are being written  evolver, dRK, neon apple, 
mdk and crackrock. I'm sure there are many many more that I've missed.


All the following command are available from within BitchX. Documentation on
these commands can be found in one of two places. BitchX.help and the epic
help files which are also available in html format.

BitchX: Commands:

#               
	A comment. Actually meant for script usage.

4OP [nick]
	ops the nick specified 4 times.
:               
	A comment. Actually meant for script usage.

ABORT          
	This is not a terribly useful command. What it does is abort the
	client and drop you back to the shell.

ABOUT           
	Display the about screen for the client with some a list of some of
	the people who have helped to make bitchx what it is.

ADDFORWARD [nick|#channel]
	Forwards all msgs recieved to another nick or channel.

FTP             
	This is an actual ftp command that will allow you to login to a ftp
server and download files. A query can be setup to make it easier to send
commands to the ftp server. Also the <TAB> key keeps the ftp server in
memory so that we can just press tab to bring up the ftp sitename. An
example of this is  /msg -sunsite.unc.edu ls 
notice that there is a - in front of the sitename. This is so that the
client understands this is a ftp command and not a dcc(=).

Well I think that's it for now. I will try and expand on this documentation
in the future, documenting the very powerful / commands as well as some of
the $functions() that the scripters are using. For right now though pressing
/<esc><esc> or /<tab>  will bring up the complete list of commands and
functions. The /bhelp command documents the most important / commands. But
it does depend on the BitchX.hlp file and a properly setup $HOME directory.
At some point in the near future a complete source package for BitchX will
become available on a ftp/www site as well as for dcc in #bitchx channels.
The current version of BX97 I've decided to make non-tcl due to a problem
with a system crash in the dll's from CYGNUS.
