   locop <message>

   user mode +w turned on.  If you are not an operator, you will probably
   receive an error message when using this command.

Restrictions:
   This command is limited to irc operators.

   The existence of this command is not guaranteed.  It is easily abused by
   over-zealous operators, and some networks have it disabled completely.
   It is yet another example of a good idea gone to waste due to abuse.
