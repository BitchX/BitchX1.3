Synopsis:
   dcc send [=]<nick> <file> [<file> ...]  [-port <port>]

Description:
   DCC SEND offers files to a remote client over DCC.  The remote client
   must of course acknowledge with a DCC GET in order to begin the file
   transfer.

   If a DCC CHAT with the remote client already exists, the SEND request
   can be sent over that connection by prefixing the nickname with a '='.
   This speeds up the handshake considerably.  Of course, the remote
   client must be able to deal with CTCP commands sent over DCC.

   A specific local port may be specified for the transfer.  This is useful
   to users behind a firewall that only permits inbound connections on
   specific port numbers.

Options:
   -port   use s specific local port

Examples:
   To send a file to joebob:
      /dcc send joebob somefile
